# Ruby NoMethodError Example

This repository demonstrates a common Ruby error: the `NoMethodError`.  The `bug.rb` file contains code that attempts to call a method that doesn't exist on a class, resulting in this error. The solution is shown in `bugSolution.rb`.

The `NoMethodError` is raised when you try to call a method that is not defined for a particular object.  This is a frequent source of bugs, especially when working with external libraries or when refactoring code.
